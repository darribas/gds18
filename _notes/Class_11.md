### To do before class

* Talk by Dan Graham ([22min. video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKGyMRIxYc)) where he clearly explains the main issues about causality using transport studies as the domain of application.
* Talk by George Davey Smith about causality in epidemiology ([30min. video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v1-kNLfhvg)). Some of the concepts here are a bit advanced, but the examples are great.

### Related readings

* Chapter 9 of {% cite gelman2006data %} is a good introduction into causality in regression models. Chapter 10 of the same book covers a bit more advanced topics.
* {% cite angrist2008mostly %} is one of the best treatments of causal inference but is not entirely introductory. A gentler coverage of similar topics is available on a more recent book {% cite angrist2014mastering %}.
