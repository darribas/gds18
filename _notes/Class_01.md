### To do before class

As a way to wet your apetite about the content of the first class, I recommend you:

* Listen to [this interview](http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/solving-lifes-everyday-problems-with-data/) with Hilary Mason, Max Shron, and Alex Pentland about the power of data.

* Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1ImEQKSkUQ) by Mike Flowers, Chief Analytics Officer, at the City of New York about how data is used to influence policy decisions.
