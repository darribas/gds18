### Data

This session uses the **"Census socio-demographics"** datasets. Go to the [Datasets](../datasets.html) tab to find out more information as well as instructions to download it.

### Additional materials

* A good extension of this session is {% cite Wickham:2014:JSSOBK:v59i10 %}. The paper is published under an Open Access license so it is freely available on the journal's site, but the author has also made available a public [repository](https://github.com/hadley/tidy-data) with the data and code used in the paper. Keep in mind the paper and the code that comes with it are based on R, not on Python.
* **[Visualization]** Python library `seaborn` [tutorial](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial.html).
* **[Recommended]** {% cite mckinney2012python %}: excellent introduction to Python for data analysis, with plenty of examples and code snippets (Publisher's page [link](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)).
* [NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html?_r=0) about the importance of cleaning data.
