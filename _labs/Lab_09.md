### Additional materials

* A very good resource for kernel density estimation in Python is provided in [this blog post](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/kernel-density-estimation/) by Jake Vanderplas.
* The R package [`spatstat`](http://spatstat.github.io/) provides extensive functionality to statistically describe and model point patterns.
