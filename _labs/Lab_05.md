### Data

This session uses the **"Index of Multiple Deprivation""** dataset. Go to the [Datasets](../datasets.html) tab to find out more information as well as instructions to download it.

### Required before the practical

Watch the section on spatial weights of the SciPy'16 tutorial on Geographic Data Science with PySAL.

### Additional materials

* The ["User Guides"](http://pysal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/users/tutorials/index.html) in `PySAL`'s documentation are an excellent resource to better get to know the library. 
* For this lab, the one about [Spatial Weights](http://pysal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/users/tutorials/weights.html) is particularly useful.
