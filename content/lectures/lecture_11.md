## Correlation Vs Causation

## Correlation Vs Causation

Two fundamental ways to look at the relationship between two (or more)
variables:

<div class="fragment">
**`Correlation`**

Two variables have **co-movement**. If we know the value of one, we know something
about the value of the other one.
</div>

<div class="fragment">
**`Causation`**

There is a **"cause-effect"** link between the two and, as a result, they display
co-movement.
</div>

## Correlation Vs Causation

* Both are useful, but for different purposes

* Causation *implies* correlation but **not** the other way around

* It is vital to keep this distinction in mind for meaningful and credible analysis

## Examples

*Sign correlation? Causal link?*

Take a guess (2mins)...

* Temperature and ice-cream consumption 
   <span class="fragment"> $\rightarrow$ **Positive**. **Positive**.
* Non-commercial space launches & Sociology PhDs awarded
* Crime & policing
* IMD in an area Vs its neighbors (Liverpool)

## Examples

*Positive or negative correlation? Causal link?*

Take a guess (2mins)...

* Temperature and ice-cream consumption $\rightarrow$ **Positive**. **Positive**.
* Non-commercial space launches & Sociology PhDs awarded $\rightarrow$ **Positive**. **None**.
* Crime & policing
   <span class="fragment"> $\rightarrow$ **Positive**. **Negative**.</span>
* IMD in an area Vs its neighbors (Liverpool)

#
## *Why/When to get Causal?*

## Why

* Most often, we are interested in understanding the **processes** that *generate*
  the world, not only in observing its outcomes
* Many of these processes are only **indirectly observable** through
  **outcomes**
* The only way to link both is through **causal channels**

## When

Essentially when the **core interest** is to find out if **something *causes* something else**

* Policy interventions
* Medical trials
* Business decisions (product/feature development...)
* Empirical (Social) Sciences
* ...

## When Not (necessarily)

<div class='fragment'>
**`Exploratory analysis`**

Distracting if not enough knowledge about the dataset
</div>

<div class='fragment'>
**`Predictive settings`**

**Interest** not in understanding the underlying
mechanisms but want to obtain **best possible estimates** of a variable you do not have by
combining others you do have 
<small style='vertical-align:middle;'>
(e.g. Kriging) </small>
</div>

#
## Hurdles to Causal Inference
## Hurdles to causal inference
Causation *implies* Correlation

Correlation *does **not** imply* Causation

*Why?*

<div class="fragment">
* Reverse causality 
* Confounding factors/endogeneity
</div>

## Reverse Causality

There *is* a causal link between the two variables but it either runs the
oposite direction as we think, or runs in both

<div class='fragment'>
E.g. Education and income
</div>

## Confounding Factors

Two variables are correlated because they are *both* determined by other,
unobserved, variables (factors) that *confound* the effect

<div class='fragment'>
E.g. Ice cream and cold beverages consumption 
</div>

#
## Strategies
## 

*Is there any way to overcome reverse causality and confounding factors to
recover causal effects?*

<span class='fragment'>
The key is to get an **"*exogenous source of variation*"**

## Strategies

<div class="fragment">
**`Randomized Control Trials`**

<small>
*Treated* Vs *control* groups. Probability of treatment is independent of everything else
</small>
</div>

<div class="fragment">
**`Quasi-natural experiments`**

<small>
Like a RCT, but that just *"happen to occur **naturally**"* (natural dissasters,
exogenous law changes...)
</small>
</div>

<div class="fragment">
**`Econometric techniques`**

<small>
For the interested reader: space-time regression, instrumental variables, propensity
score matching, differences-in-differences, regression discontinuity...
</small>
</div>

#
## Correlation *or* Causation?

<div class="fragment">
Establishing **causality is much harder** than identifying correlation,
<span class="fragment">
but sometimes it's needed to move forward!
</div>

<div class="fragment">
Correlation *precludes* causation and, in some cases, it is all that is needed.
</div>

<div class="fragment">
It is **important** to always draw *conclusions based on analysis*, know
what the data can and cannot tell, and stay **honest**.
</div>
