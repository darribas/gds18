### **Assignment 3** - *Targetting areas*

* Type: `Coursework`
* [Equivalent to 2,500 words] Three maps/tables, code and 750 words.
* 50% of the final mark
* Chance to be reassessed
* Final Assessment
* Due on **Friday, December 14th-2018** (Week 12).
* Electronic submission only. Static HTML with NO interactive cells.

In this assignment, you will take the role of a real-world data scientist tasked to identify areas to direct investments. You are consulting for the City of Liverpool on a program to target investments towards particularly disadvantaged areas that are nevertheless popular or have the potential to become so. The Economic Development division knows that only five local super output areas (LSOAs) will be funded but would like to know which ones.

Develop a data strategy, deploy it, and present the results in a rigorous but intuitive fashion, together with the code.

**Minimum requirements** (complete *all*)

* Combine *at least two* datasets, potentially among those used in the course.
* Employ *at least two* techniques from the set of analytics covered in the course.
* Justify why you have chosen the methods you use and how they help you answer the question at hand. Critically discuss their limitations too.
* Provide a list of the top five areas that you recommend be funded for improvement.
* Explain clearly how you have arrived at the list and how the decision has been informed by the data analysis and the methodologies employed.
* Include documented code that demonstrate programming understanding of the student.

**Suggestive paths** (optional)

* Combine a LISA analysis of deprivation with kernel density maps of Twitter activity to identify areas of high values at both.
* Combine several relevant variables into a geodemographic analysis to obtain candidate areas and display the results in an aesthetically pleasant choropleth.

**Data**

This assignment can use any of the [datasets]({{site.baseurl}}/datasets.html) employed in the course, and/or any other datasets you consider useful. If you are thinking of including additional datasets, or have ideas in this respect, please get in touch with the module lead ([Dani Arribas-Bel](mailto:D.Arribas-Bel@liverpool.ac.uk)).

**IMPORTANT - MSc Students**: MSc students are *required* to use alternative datasets.
