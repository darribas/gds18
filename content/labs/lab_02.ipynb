    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook (and later on as well), we will use the [CDRC](http://cdrc.ac.uk/)'s Census Data Pack for the city of Liverpool ([link](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/cdrc-2011-census-data-packs-for-local-authority-district-liverpool-e08000012)) and explore some of the city's socio-demogaphic characteristics. This is a large package crafted by the CDRC that brings together several Census tables in a consistent way for the city of Liverpool. We will only be able to use just a few of them but, since they are consistently organized, the procedure used should teach you how to explore other variables on your own. In particular, in this session, we will be using a table that lists **population by country of birth**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pack is composed of two types of data: tabular and spatial. Tabular data are numerical tables that contain information relating to many socio-economic variables for different units (areas); spatial data contains the geometries of the areas in which Liverpool is divided into. Since there are many variables contained in several tables, that can be linked to more than one geography, the pack also includes two \"compass files\" that help you find what you are looking for: one table that lists and describes the different datasets available; and a much more detailed table that lists and describes each and every single variable available in the pack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder assumes you have downloaded and unpacked the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: if you are working on a university lab computer, make sure to store the downloaded files (as well as the notebook) in the `M:` drive. This will ensure it is safe and does not get erased.\n",

    "It is not only that data are not ready to analyze when you get a hold on them. Sometimes, there is not such thing as *the dataset* to analyze. Instead, what you have is a collection of separated files, sometimes with different structures, that you need to bring together to begin with. This is one of the areas where a bit of scripting skills can help you a long way. While in a traditional point-and-click program like Microsoft Excel or SPSS, you would have to repeat the steps every time you wanted to incorporate a new dataset, with a bit of Python ninja tricks, you can write code that will do it for you as many times as you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin jumping straight into the analysis of population in Liverpool, organized by country of birth, at the Local Super Output Area (LSOA) level. Because the Census Data Pack contains a lot of data and very many different tables, you will have to bear with us and trust that what we are extracting is exactly the data of interest. This will speed up the process to walk through the reading, processing and manipulating of a dataset. Once you are familiar with these skills, the final section goes into how to explore the entire pack with more detail.\n",
