#### John Snow's Cholera map

This is the dataset of the results of the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU, at the local authority level. All the necessary data have been assembled for convenience in a single file that contains geographic information about each local authority in England, Wales and Scotland, as well as the vote attributes. The file is in the modern geospatial format [GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org/), which presents several advantages over the more traditional shapefile (chief among them, the need of a single file instead of several). The file is available as a download from the course website on the following link:
